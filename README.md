# Description
Project_Closed_Loop is the primary script for running experiments. Doing so with 12x parallel processing should take 4 minutes. Please adjust max_workers to fit your machine - recommend using half of your cores. 

Running the script will create a series of data files. To analyze, various analysis functions are available in Project_Analyze. Comment or uncomment the lines at the bottom of the script as desired.
